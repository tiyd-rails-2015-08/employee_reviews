# Employee Reviews

## Description

Create classes to track employees and their departments, interpret employee reviews, and give out raises to those with good reviews.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand blocks in Ruby
* Understand simple classification problems
* Reflect on how natural language can be read by a computer to convert it to quantitative data
* Be able to write code using test-driven development
* Be able to use regular expressions
* Be able to use keyword arguments
* Be able to write a method which calls a block

## Deliverables

* **An estimate.** After you read through this assignment (but before you start coding), write down a number of hours that you expect each part to take (1-3).  Record your hours as you go.
* **A GitHub repository.**
* **An Employee class in its own file.**
* **A Department class in its own file.**
* **A quality README.**
* **A test suite.** Not only must this test suite be conceptually complete, it must be written before the code that satisfies it.
* **A reflection on your estimate.**  Well?  How did you do?

## Normal Mode

#### Part 1

You want to keep track of employees (with their names, email addresses, phone numbers, and salaries), departments (with their names), and which employees are in which department.  You should be able to:

* Create a new department (given its name).
* Create a new employee (given his/her name, email address, phone number, and salary).
* Add an employee to a department.
* Get an employee's name.
* Get an employee's salary.
* Get a department's name.
* Get a total salary for all employees in a department.
* Add some employee review text (a paragraph or two) to an employee.
* Mark whether an employee is performing satisfactorily or not satisfactorily.
* Give a raise to an individual.  You decide if this makes sense in dollars or in percent.
* Give raises to a department's employees.  You must pass this method a total dollar amount, and it must distribute the raise amounts reasonably to the department's employees.  Only employees who are performing satisfactorily should get raises.

Commit your code after you complete each requirement (or more often).

At this stage, your code should:

* Use keyword arguments at least once.

Finally, all of this code must be written using test-driven development.  Your test suite should have at least one complete example (also known as a "pathological" example) of how the two classes can be used in the real world.

#### Part 2

Once your baseline app is complete, modify your method on Departments which gives out raises.  It should now take a block which will specify which employees are eligible for raises.  Prior to this stage, you only allowed "satisfactory" employees to get raises, but now it can be more flexible.

For instance, if a department had $5,000 to spread out to its employees in raises, but you wanted to only give raises to people who only made less than $100,000, you could call a `give_raises` method like this:

    department.give_raises(5000) do |employee|
      employee.salary < 100000
    end

At this stage, your code should:

* Have a method which takes a block and calls `yield`.

#### Part 3

As part of this repository, you have a file called `sample_reviews.txt`.  This file includes two negative employee reviews and two positive employee reviews.  Your task is to write a method on the employee class which looks the employee review text stored in an employee instance variable (in Part 1) and return a `true` or `false` for whether this employee is performing satisfactorily.  This also means that you will be removing the ability for users to manually mark whether an employee is performing satisfactorily.  This will now be determined by code.

Regular expressions will be your friend here (and are required for this assignment, even if you could do it without them).  Even so, this is not an easy problem.  It is in a category of problems called "Natural Language Processing," and since you are attempting to take reviews and place them in one of two buckets (satisfactory or not), it is known as a "Classification" problem.

At this stage, your code should also:

* Use at least one non-trivial regular expression (i.e. Don't just look for a literal string like `/good/`).

## Hard Mode

As mentioned above, placing reviews into two buckets is a "Classification" problem.  Your task in Nightmare Mode is to solve a "Regression" problem instead.  Assign each employee a SCORE based on his/her review rather than a yes/no value.  After creating this method, modify your departmental raise function to take this score value into account when giving out raises.

Finally, go out on the Internet and search for at least three examples of good review texts and three examples of bad review texts.  Pass them into your algorithm and see if you agree with its assessment.

## Nightmare Mode

Up until this point in the class, you have assumed that when your program ends, all objects created by your code are lost.  For instance, if you make a new employee with a name of "Janice", no record of Janice will exist for the next execution of the code to find.

Modify your code so that if employees and departments are made once, they will be available for all subsequent runs of your application.
